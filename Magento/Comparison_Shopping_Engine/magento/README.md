Example Magento extensions to make use of X.commerce contracts/capabilities
=============

This folder contains some experimental extensions that we wrote to communicate from Magento store to X.commerce fabric.
Please remember that these are in no way complete but intend to serve as proof of concepts. As with Magento, there are several
ways in which the same things can be accomplished. If you have a better way to demonstrate the same functionality, we would love
to take your suggestions.
