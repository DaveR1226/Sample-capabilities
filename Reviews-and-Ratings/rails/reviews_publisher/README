== Reviews Publisher Capability in Rails 3.1

This is a sample capability for subscribing to a reviews and ratings system. This capability can be fully expanded and customized.
The intention for this capability is to serve as a reviews publisher who can provide reviews for marketplace products based on catalog information.
This ideally, would be hooked on to any marketplace like eBay, Amazon, Shopify, Google, etc that provides a facility to gather product reviews.



== Overview
Writing a basic capability in rails hardly 30 minutes. This document will give you an overview of what to do from the Rails side of things. 
This document will not over how to create a capability in X.manager and subscribe to the topics. The way this capability has been written,
1. The fabric is running on localhost:8080

2. The capability has an end point localhost:3000 or whatever port the rails server is running on

3. The capability subscribes to the topic in the Avro file, that is included in the home directory. (/product/reviews/find,/product/reviews/search,/product/reviews/udpate)


== Rails specific stuff
1. Use the AVRO gem from the X.commerce git repo. Add this line in your gemfile.
gem 'avro', :git => 'git://github.com/xcommerce/avro-ruby.git'

2. Make sure you capture all the routes for the subscribed topics and route it to the proper controller action

3. In addition to this, you need to create general routes like /xfabric/tenant/updated, /message/failed that originate from the Fabric based on its inherent protocols.

4. Check the schema out in config/schema.rb. This is the AVRO schema. You can modify it to suit your needs.
