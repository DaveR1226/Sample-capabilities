Ruby Example
====

This was inspired by the CloudFoundry open tour talk in Austin. I changed the Fibonacci capability to work with 
CloudFoundry.

1. Create a CF account (https://cloudfoundry.com)
2. Install the vmc tool
3. Use bundler to specify the dependencies (sinatra,avro,etc)
4. Push two clients as seperate CF applications.
